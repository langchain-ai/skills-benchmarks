LangGraph's persistence layer enables durable execution by checkpointing graph state:

- **Checkpointer**: Saves/loads graph state at every super-step
- **Thread ID**: Identifies separate checkpoint sequences (conversations)
- **Store**: Cross-thread memory for user preferences, facts

**Two memory types:**
- **Short-term** (checkpointer): Thread-scoped conversation history
- **Long-term** (store): Cross-thread user preferences, facts
