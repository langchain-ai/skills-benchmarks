LangGraph's persistence layer enables durable execution by checkpointing graph state at every super-step. This unlocks human-in-the-loop, memory, time travel, and fault-tolerance capabilities.

**Key Components:**
- **Checkpointer**: Saves/loads graph state
- **Thread ID**: Identifier for checkpoint sequences
- **Checkpoints**: Snapshots of state at each step
