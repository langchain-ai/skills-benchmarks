Split documents into chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter with configurable size and overlap.
```python
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=1000,        # Characters per chunk
    chunk_overlap=200,      # Overlap for context continuity
    separators=["\n\n", "\n", " ", ""],  # Split hierarchy
)

splits = splitter.split_documents(docs)
```
