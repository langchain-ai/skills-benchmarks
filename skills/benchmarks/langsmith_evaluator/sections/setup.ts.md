Environment Variables

```bash
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=lsv2_pt_your_api_key_here          # Required
LANGSMITH_PROJECT=your-project-name                   # Check this to know which project has traces
LANGSMITH_WORKSPACE_ID=your-workspace-id              # Optional: for org-scoped keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key                        # For LLM as Judge
```

**IMPORTANT:** Always check the environment variables or `.env` file for `LANGSMITH_PROJECT` before querying or interacting with LangSmith. This tells you which project contains the relevant traces and data. If the LangSmith project is not available, use your best judgement to identify the right one.
