Deep Agents are an opinionated agent framework built on top of LangChain and LangGraph, designed for complex, multi-step tasks. They come "batteries included" with built-in capabilities:

- **Task Planning**: TodoListMiddleware for breaking down complex tasks
- **Context Management**: Filesystem tools with pluggable backends
- **Task Delegation**: SubAgent middleware for spawning specialized agents
- **Long-term Memory**: Persistent storage across threads via Store
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Approval workflows for sensitive operations

Deep Agents use an "agent harness" architecture - the same core tool-calling loop as other frameworks, but with pre-configured middleware and tools.
