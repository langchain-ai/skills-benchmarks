Define state schema with reducers for accumulating lists and summing integers.
```python
from typing_extensions import TypedDict, Annotated
import operator

class State(TypedDict):
    name: str  # Default: overwrites on update
    messages: Annotated[list, operator.add]  # Appends to list
    total: Annotated[int, operator.add]  # Sums integers
```
