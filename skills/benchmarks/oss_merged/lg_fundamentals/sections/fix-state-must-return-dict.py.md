Nodes must return partial updates, not mutate and return full state.
```python
# WRONG: Returning entire state object
def my_node(state: State) -> State:
    state["field"] = "updated"
    return state  # Don't mutate and return!

# CORRECT: Return dict with only the updates
def my_node(state: State) -> dict:
    return {"field": "updated"}
```
