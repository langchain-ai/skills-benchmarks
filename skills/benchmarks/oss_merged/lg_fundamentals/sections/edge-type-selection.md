| Need | Edge Type | When to Use |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Always go to same node | `add_edge()` | Fixed, deterministic flow |
| Route based on state | `add_conditional_edges()` | Dynamic branching |
| Update state AND route | `Command` | Combine logic in single node |
| Fan-out to multiple nodes | `Send` | Parallel processing with dynamic inputs |
